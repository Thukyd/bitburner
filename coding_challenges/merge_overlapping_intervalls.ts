Merge Overlapping Intervals
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 15 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


Given the following array of array of numbers representing a list of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

[[17,23],[2,7],[3,11],[10,14],[24,25],[18,19],[18,27],[5,10],[9,17],[15,22],[12,13],[22,26],[6,15],[2,4]]

Example:

[[1, 3], [8, 10], [2, 6], [10, 16]]

would merge into [[1, 6], [8, 16]].

The intervals must be returned in ASCENDING order. You can assume that in an interval, the first number will always be smaller than the second.
