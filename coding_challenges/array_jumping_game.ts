Array Jumping Game
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 1 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


You are given the following array of integers:

1,0,6

Each element in the array represents your MAXIMUM jump length at that position. This means that if you are at position i and your maximum jump length is n, you can jump to any position from i to i+n.

Assuming you are initially positioned at the start of the array, determine whether you are able to reach the last index.

let arr = [1,0,6]

// no!
