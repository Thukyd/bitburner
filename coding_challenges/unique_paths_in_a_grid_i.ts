Unique Paths in a Grid I
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 10 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


You are in a grid with 10 rows and 2 columns, and you are positioned in the top-left corner of that grid. You are trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid, but you can only move down or right on each step. Determine how many unique paths there are from start to finish.

NOTE: The data returned for this contract is an array with the number of rows and columns:

[10, 2]
